# Memory color theme

This color theme is used by me for many years. Example of this color theme
with "Xi" personal wiki markup language:

## Color usage

### Background

Taken long time ago from the code sample on the Ruby programming language
[homepage](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and modified a bit to fit into
`HSV` round values. On the HSV color wheel the color is located between blue
and cyan (210 degrees) and has no distinctive name as far as I know.
Saturation is decreased to 50% and value is decreased to 30%.

### Foreground

As with all color themes it's complimentary to background. Appears to be
a nice shade of sand and reminds me old "Yellow on blue" Norton Commander
color theme, just not **that** bright.

### Heading 1

The color theme is tailored towards Xi markup language and should make
6 levels of headers to stand out from plain text, code smaples, terms and
highlights. The first color is yellow (60 degrees HSV color wheel) with
a value slightly reduced to 90%. For programming languages it's used to
mark common things that stand out: keywords and tag names.
