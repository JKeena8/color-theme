# Memory color theme

This color theme is used by me for many years. Example of this color theme
with "Xi" personal wiki markup language:

## Color usage

### Background

Taken long time ago from the code sample on the Ruby programming language
[homepage](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and modified a bit to fit into
`HSV` round values. On the HSV color wheel the color is located between blue
and cyan (210 degrees) and has no distinctive name as far as I know.
Saturation is decreased to 50% and value is decreased to 30%.

### Foreground

As with all color themes it's complimentary to background. Appears to be
a nice shade of sand and reminds me old "Yellow on blue" Norton Commander
color theme, just not **that** bright.

### Heading 1

The color theme is tailored towards Xi markup language and should make
6 levels of headers to stand out from plain text, code smaples, terms and
highlights. The first color is yellow (60 degrees HSV color wheel) with
a value slightly reduced to 90%. For programming languages it's used to
mark common things that stand out: keywords and tag names:

### Heading 2

Second color is a cyan (180 degrees HSV) with value decreaded to 70%, making
it less bright. Like yellow for h1, this color is completely different from
foreground color while not being as acid as magenta or red. For programming
lagnugae it's used to mark second common thing that stand out: different
kinds of callables, both declaration and reference. This includes functions,
methods, named code blocks and so on:
